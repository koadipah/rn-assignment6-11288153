# Design Functionalities

- Each product item includes an image, title, description, price, and an "Add to Cart" button in the Homescreen.
- The "Add to Cart" button is designed as a plus icon located at the bottom right of each product card.
- Each cart item includes an image, title, price, and a "Remove" button in the Checkout interface
- The total price of all items in the cart is displayed at the bottom of the screen.
